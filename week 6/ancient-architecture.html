            Ancient Roman architecture adopted the external language of classical Greek architecture for the
            purposes of the ancient Romans, but grew so different from Greek buildings as to become a new
            architectural style. The two styles are often considered one body of classical architecture. Roman
            architecture flourished in the Roman Republic and even more so under the Empire, when the great
            majority of surviving buildings were constructed. It used new materials, particularly concrete, and
            newer technologies such as the arch and the dome to make buildings that were typically strong and
            well-engineered. Large numbers remain in some form across the empire, sometimes complete and still
            in use.

        <h2>Ancient Greek architecture</h2>

            The architecture of ancient Greece is the architecture produced by the Greek-speaking people
            (Hellenic people) whose culture flourished on the Greek mainland, the Peloponnese, the Aegean
            Islands, and in colonies in Anatolia and Italy for a period from about 900 BC until the 1st century
            AD, with the earliest remaining architectural works dating from around 600 BC.[1]
            Ancient Greek architecture is best known from its temples, many of which are found throughout the
            region, mostly as ruins but many substantially intact. The second important type of building that
            survives all over the Hellenic world is the open-air theatre, with the earliest dating from around
            525-480 BC.

        <h2>Ancient Indian Architecture</h2>
        <h3>Posted on 01.01.2017 by <a href="#">Someone</a></h3>
        <img src="images/ancient-indian-architecture.jpg" alt=""/>
        <p>
            Indian architecture is as old as the history of the civilization.The earliest remains of
            recognizable building activity in the India dates back to the Indus Valley cities. Among India's
            ancient architectural remains, the most characteristic are the temples, Chaityas, Viharas, Stupas
            and other religious structures. In ancient India, temple architecture of high standard developed in
            almost all regions. The distinct architectural style of temple construction in different parts was a
            result of geographical, climatic, ethnic, racial, historical and linguistic diversities.
            The Rock-cut structures present the most spectacular piece of ancient Indian art specimen. Most of
            the rock-cut structures were related to various religious communities.
